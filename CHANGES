    [Bug fix]

        Uses floating-point with no decimal places rather than integers to
        avoid rounding errors on Perls compiled with long doubles
        (which is ironically supposed to give you *more* precision).

        Compiles under perl 5.8.9.

    [Features]

        You can supply a coderef to time instead of a function name; the
        resulting wrapped coderef is returned to you.
    
        You can supply the name of a function in your own package to
        time_function() without having to fully-quantify it.
        
        You can supply an alternate name to use in reports instead of the
        function name you specified. This is most obviously useful when you
        supply a coderef.
        
    [Bug fix]
    
        Some functions weren't marked as exportable: add_milestone was
        misspelled; generate_intermediate_report and generate_final_report
        were omitted entirely.
        
        Functions weren't being unwrapped when timing stopped.
