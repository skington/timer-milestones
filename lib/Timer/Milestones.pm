Timer::Milestones - measure code execution time succinctly by setting milestones

=head1 VERSION

This is version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Timer::Milestones qw(start_timing add_milestone stop_timing
     time_function);

 start_timing();
 time_function('Some::ThirdParty::Module::do_slow_thing');

 my @objects = _set_up_objects();

 add_milestone('Everything set up');

 for my $object (@objects) {
     _do_something_potentially_slow($object);
 }

 add_milestone('Telling the user')

 for my $object (@objects) {
     _inform_user($object);
 }
 ...

 stop_timing();

Spits out to STDERR e.g.

 START: Tue Feb  4 16:03:08 2020
      3 s (  0.28%)
 Everything set up
      5 min 30 s ( 31.22%)
          3 min  7 s Some::ThirdParty::Module::do_slow_thing
 Telling the user
     12 min  7 s ( 68.78%)
          8 min 30 s Some::ThirdParty::Module::do_slow_thing (x3)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

At its simplest, Timer::Milestones is yet another timer module. It is designed
to have the smallest possible interface, so adding timing calls to your code
doesn't make it look unreadable. It can also time execution time of functions
in other modules, as a more informative (and quicker!) alternative to running
everything under Devel::NYTProf.

=head2 Functional vs OO interface

You can use Timer::Milestones via a functional interface:

 use Timer::Milestones qw(start_timing add_milestone stop_timing);
 start_timing();
 ...;
 add_milestone('Half-way through');
 ...;
 stop_timing();

Or via an OO interface:

 use Timer::Milestones;
 {
     my $timer = Timer::Milestones->new;
     # $timer->start_timing automatically called
     ...;
     $timer->add_milestone('Half-way through');
     ...;
 }
 # $timer->stop_timing automatically called when $timer is destroyed

The OO interface is simpler if you're timing a monolithic block of code. If you
need to add timing calls throughout code scattered across multiple files, you're
better off with the functional interface as you don't need to pass a
Timer::Milestone object around.

=head2 Milestones and reports

At its simplest, the report you get will include when timing started and when
timing ended. These are displayed in your locale's local time, on the assumption
that that's what makes sense to you.

As soon as you add milestones, you will also be told how much time passed
between the start, each milestone, and the end. Times are specified in both
human-friendly periods (a number of milliseconds; seconds; minutes and seconds;
or hours and minutes), and percentages of the total elapsed time.

If you decide that you want to L<time individual functions as
well|/time_function>, they'll be mentioned with the milestones they follow. If
you provide a coderef to summarise the arguments passed to them that will be
included; if you decide that you don't need to see individual timings for each
function call, just an overall time, you'll get a shorter list of function
calls and an overall time.

 In: $name (optional)

Adds another milestone. If supplied with a name, uses that name for the

=head2 Timing other people's code

Adding calls to L</add_milestone> throughout your code is all very well, but
sometimes you want to time a small handful of methods deep in someone else's
code (or deep in I<your> code - same difference). By carefully targeting only
a few methods to time, you can avoid the pitfalls of profiling with
L<Devel::NYTProf>, where code that does zillions of fast method calls will
appear to be much slower than it is when not profiling.

=head3 time_function

 In: $function_name
 In: %args (optional)

Supplied with a function name, e.g. C<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::_dbh_execute>,
and an optional hash of arguments, wraps it with a temporary shim that records
the time spent inside this function. That shim is removed, and the original
code restored, when timing stops. Details of the functions called are included
between milestones in the resulting report.

If the function is unqualified (i.e. doesn't contain C<::>) it is assumed to be
a function in the calling package, and continues to be I<called> by its
unqualified name in reports (i.e. the argument C<report_name_as) is set if
it wasn't already).

Optional arguments are as follows:

=over

=item summarise_arguments

A coderef, which will be passed the arguments passed to the function,
and which should return a scalar that will be included in the report.

=item summarise_calls

If set to a true value, repeated calls to this function will be summarised
rather than listed individually: the first time a function call is found, it
will also mention all subsequent calls.

This can combine with C<summarise_arguments>: calls which result in an
identical return value from that coderef will be combined.

=item report_name_as

If specified, the name to use in reports.

L<Timer::Simple>, which is simpler but more verbose.

L<Devel::Timer>, which does some similar things.

L<Devel::NYTProf>, which is probably worth using as a first pass, even if you
don't necessarily trust its idea of what's I<actually> slow.
